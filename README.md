# GoodOS

# Quick intro

Even though the backstory behind this "project" is in the boot.asm, I will give some info about it:

The OS is a **monolithic bootloader**, which I have named because I dont know the actual name of something like this

Basically, all the code is inside of the bootloader, which was an experiment I thought of while fixing gcc errors on my main OS project

## This is ***Experimental***, so obviously some stuff's not gonna work, like I don't think I can add a GUI or anything graphical except maybe an IDE in the long-term to code in Assembly or something

Anyway, I'm gonna finish the read me here because im gonna work on the project

# Also, do not expect the finished project to be full of features - remember, I need to write the code within a Bootloader, which must be optimized to the MAX so I dont exceed the max space limit, and if I'd want to exceed it, I'd have to add a second bootloader stage which, actually now that I write about it, I might do that
